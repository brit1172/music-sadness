<h3>Music's Impact on Mental Health</h3>
<p>We tend to listen to music that reflects our mood. When we are happy, we may listen to upbeat music; when we are sad we may listen to slower, moving songs; when we are angry we may listen to darker music that reflect our level of anger.

Music can be a powerful emotional tool. The emotions evoked by music don't just feel good,they're healthy for you, too. A meta-analysis of 400 music studies found that listening to music has the ability to reduce anxiety, fight depression and boost the immune system.

<h3> The Connection Between Music, Colors, and Mood</h3>
<p>Our emotions match music to colors.our brains are able to make music-color connections depending on how the melodies make us feel.according to research done by the University of California, Berkeley.Using a 37-color palette,the study found that people tend to pair faster-paced music with lighter, more vivid, yellow colors, while slower-paced music is more likely to be teamed up with darker, grayer, bluer colors.
